# Get Digital Materials Under Control

## Problem

The digital materials sourced for preservation are usually in a condition that makes their preservation difficult to manage. How can we get such digital materials under the degree of control necessary to enable their long-term preservation?

## Context

'Getting digital materials under control' means managing the transfer of those materials from the jurisdiction of the donor to that of the collecting organisation, and then arranging them in ways that minimise the impact of **obsolescence**, **obscurity** and **degradation**. The materials in question may be poorly understood by the collecting organisation, or they may have been poorly-maintained by the donor (e.g. they could be infected with a virus). The collecting organisation will also need to ensure that they have _only_ collected the materials they agreed to collect, and haven't inadvertently collected more. They will also need to ensure that the materials are organised in ways that enable them to be stored so that they can accessed and used in future, even in the far future when the software needed to use them is no longer readily available.

## Forces

This pattern is generally one of organisation and method versus disorganisation and chaos. The pattern is based, fundamentally, upon the need to follow the plan agreed between the donor and the collector when the digital materials being preserved were first [sourced](SourceThingsToPreserve.md). Proving that this plan has been followed (e.g. that the agreed materials, and _only_ the agreed materials, have been transferred correctly to the collecting organisation), is harder with digital materials than with physical objects: for instance, transferring copies successfully requires checksumming to prove that exact copies have been transferred, and that the donated materials are free from viruses that could infect future users of the materials. 

Digital files may also be donated in a messy condition; i.e with meaningless names, or names that derive meaning from their original contexts, and which cease to make sense once they are moved. They may also have been donated in formats that are already obscure, which might mean that the donated files need to be transformed into a more stable, less obscure formats  to preserved them in states that will ensure more long-term usefulness.

However, as the donated materials have value (assuming they have been sourced correctly) , it is also important to ensure that such value is properly understood by maintaining their integrity. This is achieved by ensuring that information about the context and provenance of the original donation is maintained.

## Solution

Getting things under control is the part of Digital Preservation where the greatest amount of work is performed, and a lot of this work is very technical in nature. Towards the start of this phase of the process, there are sets of tasks related to **acquiring** the materials, which can be a challenging process if the materials are to be acquired safely, without, for example, overwriting them or otherwise corrupting them accidentally. Once acquired, the materials need to be **stabilised** so that any immediate risks to them are mitigated. This not only involves transferring them to a safe workspace location in the collecting institution, but also includes processes such as checking them for viruses. Once stable, the collected files must be **arranged**, not only by examining their relationship to each other, but also by checking certain technical aspects about them; the file type, for instance (and by extension the software needed to use them). A decision might be taken to convert the files to more usable and manageable long-term formats at this stage. A part of the process of getting things under control that iterates with arrangement is **description**, during which process various types of metadata used to help manage and access the materials in the future are created. The final part of the 'getting under control' process is to **put the materials, and related metadata to a long-term storage location** where they can be managed, and used, into the future.

## Resulting context

The process of getting things under control acquires a set of often poorly-managed materials, at risk of becoming obsolete, dwindling into obscurity, and degrading on their current storage locations, and ensures that they are stabilised, arranged and described in ways that they can be kept safely and used into the far future. 

## Rationale

A space to add more (often technical) detail about why the pattern is an appropriate solution to the problem.

## Related Patterns

These are additional to Coplein's suggested pattern structure and are inspired by Alexander et al's initial text. They are also included to address the issue of jargon in the Digital Preservation domain, and the perceived lack of a 'plain-English' description of the domain and many of its key aspects. As such, the patterns have been organised into layers of abstraction that enable both an 'elevator pitch' and 'plain-English' descriptions of the domain and levels of abstraction above the technical.
