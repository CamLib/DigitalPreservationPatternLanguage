# Source digital materials to preserve

## Problem

Preserving digital materials 'in perpetuity' means committing a great deal of resource (time, money and expertise) to the long-term maintenance of those resources. How can we ensure that the resources we commit to preserving are worth the preservation effort?

## Context

Once we have committed to preserving a piece of digital material, we have committed to two things:

1. The meticulous tasks of preparing the materials for long-term preservation (i.e. 'getting the resource under control'). 
2. The longer-term effort of maintaining the usefulness of those preserved materials.

This is a big committment, even for a small number of digital materials. (If we take 'in perpetuity' literally, it is, in fact, the committment of *infinite* resources!)

We must, therefore, strive to ensure that the digital materials we select are worth the effort; i.e. that they are likely to be of interest and value to users far into the future. We can achieve this by **engaging** with the creators and owners of interesting, valuable digital materials, then **surveying** the materials they have in order to **select** the most interesting and valuable ones for preservation.

## Forces

The key force at play in this pattern is the value of the digital materials that are potentially in need of preservation. When considering that materials may need to be preserved 'in perpetuity', this force is very hard to measure. The quality of the materials and their relevance to the collecting organisations existing collection are major forces at work. The reputation of the creator of the materials, and the context within which it was created, are also at play in the evaluation decision.

One of the key forces involved in sourcing digital materials is how attractive the collecting / preserving organisation is to the creator / donor of the materials; in other words, how **engaged** the creator / donor is, and how much they trust the collecting organisation. The reputation of the collecting organisation, which may be reinforced by evidence that it has reached a given level of ability in collecting and preserving digital materials, is a major force. However, a productive and trusting personal relationship between the collector themselves (usually an archivist) and the donor of the materials is also incredibly important. Of course, the attractive forces of other (rival?) collecting organisations are also at play here. 

Once a potential donor of digital materials is engaged, the will allow their digital materials to be **surveyed**. Forces such as the age and quality of the donor's computer equipment come into play here, as well as the personality and general disposition of the donor(s) themselves. 

All of the forces at work in sourcing digital materials can be tempered to an extent by effective policies regarding the **selection** of materials on the part of the preserving organisation, and the activity of tying individual selection decisions back into the collection strategies and policies of the collecting organisation.


## Solution

The approach to solving the problem, written in the plainest English possible. At higher levels of abstraction, the solution is likely to refer to one or more child patterns (see below).

## Resulting context

How the context of the problem is expected to change for the better if the pattern is applied to solve the problem.

## Rationale

A space to add more (often technical) detail about why the pattern is an appropriate solution to the problem.

## Related Patterns

These are additional to Coplein's suggested pattern structure and are inspired by Alexander et al's initial text. They are also included to address the issue of jargon in the Digital Preservation domain, and the perceived lack of a 'plain-English' description of the domain and many of its key aspects. As such, the patterns have been organised into layers of abstraction that enable both an 'elevator pitch' and 'plain-English' descriptions of the domain and levels of abstraction above the technical. 

(The diagram embedded in the root DigitalPreservation.md pattern helps explain the above).
