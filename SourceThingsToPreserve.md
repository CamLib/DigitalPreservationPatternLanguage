# Source digital materials to preserve

## Problem

Preserving digital materials 'in perpetuity' means committing a great deal of resource (time, money and expertise) to the long-term maintenance of those resources. How can we ensure that the resources we commit to preserving are worth the preservation effort?

## Context

Once we have committed to preserving a piece of digital material, we have committed to two things:

1. The meticulous tasks of preparing the materials for long-term preservation (i.e. 'getting the resource under control'). 
2. The longer-term effort of maintaining the usefulness of those preserved materials.

This is a big committment, even for a small number of digital materials. If we take 'in perpetuity' literally, it is, in fact, the committment of *infinite* resources!

We must, therefore, strive to ensure that the digital materials we select are worth the effort; i.e. that they are likely to be of interest and value to users far into the future. We can achieve this by **engaging** with the creators and owners of interesting, valuable digital materials, then **surveying** the materials they have in order to **select** the most interesting and valuable ones for preservation.

## Forces

The key force at play in this pattern is the value of the digital materials that are potentially in need of preservation. The quality of the materials and their relevance to the collecting organisations' existing collection are major forces at work. The reputation of the creator of the materials, and the context within which it was created, also affect the evaluation decision.

One of the key forces involved in sourcing digital materials is how attractive the collecting / preserving organisation is to the creator / donor of the materials; in other words, how **engaged** the creator / donor is, and how much they trust the collecting organisation. The reputation of the collecting organisation, which may be reinforced by evidence that it has reached a given level of ability in collecting and preserving digital materials, is a major force. However, a productive and trusting personal relationship between the individual responsible for managing the collection process and the donor of the materials is also incredibly important. Of course, the attractive forces of other (rival?) collecting organisations are also at play. 

Once a potential donor of digital materials is engaged, they will allow their digital materials to be **surveyed**. Forces such as the age and quality of the donor's computer equipment come into play here, as well as the age, quality and volume of the resources being donated. The personality and general disposition of the donor(s) themselves are also a factor. 

Counteracting the forces related to the value and nature of the materials in question are forces related to the effort required to preserve them. When considering that materials may need to be preserved 'in perpetuity', these forces are very hard to measure. 

All of the forces at work in sourcing digital materials can be tempered to an extent by effective policies regarding the **selection** of materials on the part of the preserving organisation, and the activity of tying individual selection decisions back into the collection strategies and policies of the collecting organisation.


## Solution

The foundation of the solution is the relationship between the donor(s) of the digital materials and the collecting organisation. This relationship is often embodied by the personal relationships between the donor(s) and specific individuals at the collecting organisation (usually archivists), though the archivist needs to take as much advantage as possible of the reputation of their organisation. Factors such as whether the organisation has been audited to prove its ability to look after resources may be a factor in helping build trust. The level of trust required by the donor(s) may take a long time, and a lot of effort on the part of the collector, to build.

As the relationship between donors and collectors builds, opportunities to begin surveying the potential donation(s) ought to emerge. The appropriateness of the donation will need to be assessed. This decision depends upon many factors; for instance 'non-technical factors' such as the relevance of the donation to the collection policies of the organisation or the sensitivity of the donation: e.g. does it contain personal information about third-parties that might impinge upon their privacy and hence require redaction? The appropriateness of the donation also depends upon certain technical factors, too: e.g. the age and state of the computer equipment upon which the donation is held, the size, complexity and formats of the files that are being considered etc.

The survey eventually becomes a selection process, within which the exact nature of the donation is agreed. This will tend to involve the creation of one or more manifests of donated files, which in turn should contain technical information such as the file sizes, checksums of the files, and any metadata about the files which the collecting organisations needs to ensure it can care for them in the long-term. 

The three parts of the selection solution will almost certainly be iterative: deciding what to donate is often a complicated process, and similarly, deciding what to receive often requires reference to collection policies, complex technical decisions and planning, and long-term resourcing decisions. Furthermore, there is often a formal, legal aspect to the decision, too. All this complexity usually means that the final decision is negotiated towards in repeated steps, rather than flowing neatly.

## Resulting context

The successful application of this pattern should result in:

* Donors that are confident that they have made the correct donation decision: i.e. that they know that the greatest number of people will feel the value of the materials they have donated for years to come.
* Collectors that are confident the donated materials are a good fit for their institution, and relate well to the collections they already have.
* A well-developed plan for actually managing the collection and preservation process.

Failing to apply this pattern increases the risk of damaging relationships with donors. It also increases various risks to the donated materials, e.g. the original files could be damaged, or collected in ways that prevent their long-term preservation, or they could be stored in ways that make them difficult to find and / or use in future.

## Rationale

This pattern is born of a concern that the 'traditional' focus of digital preservation has been towards *getting things under control* and [maintaining the usefulness of digital materials](MaintainTheUsefulnessOfThings.md) to the detriment of these initial steps. (The Paradigm Project is one notable exception that avoids this criticism). However, this pattern provides the foundation of the whole process: as is often the case in anything Information-Systems-related, one skimps on the groundwork at one's peril.
