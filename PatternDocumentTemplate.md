    http://www.hillside.net/patterns/50-patterns-library/patterns/222-design-pattern-definition
    
    Coplein's core definition of a pattern is:
    
    "Each pattern is a three-part rule, which expresses a relation between a certain context, 
    a certain system of forces which occurs repeatedly in that context, and a certain software configuration 
    which allows these forces to resolve themselves."
    
    ... this template is based on the example he provides, and is intended to help describe the patterns
    here in a way that supports the core definition above.
    
    This template contains the following modification the following modification:
    
    The 'parent / children' construct is inspired by the book 'A Pattern Language' by Alexander et al
    (one of the two books that inspired the patterns movement in the first place).

# Pattern Name

## Problem

A description of the problem that the pattern is intended to address that is both short and to-the-point. It should ideally end with a question of some sort, e.g. "how can we describe the pattern effectively?"

## Context

A fuller and richer description of the underlying reasons for the problem, and the surrounding elements of the system that cause it. The context should strive to describe a proven situation that people are either already familiar with, or which it is easy to point towards and provide evidence to show that the problem exists.

## Forces

A description of the direct issues that cause the problem. These are often described in terms of the surrounding sub-systems that interact with the part of the system where the problem is manifesting itself.

## Solution

The approach to solving the problem, written in the plainest English possible. At higher levels of abstraction, the solution is likely to refer to one or more child patterns (see below).

## Resulting context

How the context of the problem is expected to change for the better if the pattern is applied to solve the problem.

## Rationale

A space to add more (often technical) detail about why the pattern is an appropriate solution to the problem.

## Related Patterns

These are additional to Coplein's suggested pattern structure and are inspired by Alexander et al's initial text. They are also included to address the issue of jargon in the Digital Preservation domain, and the perceived lack of a 'plain-English' description of the domain and many of its key aspects. As such, the patterns have been organised into layers of abstraction that enable both an 'elevator pitch' and 'plain-English' descriptions of the domain and levels of abstraction above the technical. 

(The diagram embedded in the root DigitalPreservation.md pattern helps explain the above).

### Parent pattern

The more general pattern that this pattern forms part of the solution too.

### Sibling patterns

Any patterns that are directly in the same contextual space, **and at the same level of abstraction** as the pattern being described.

### Child patterns

The more specific (and usually more technical) children of this pattern, which explain problems and solutions in more detail.
